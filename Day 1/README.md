# String Reversal Using Stack in Java
+ This Java program demonstrates a simple approach to reverse a string using a stack.
## Overview 
The solution employs a stack data structure to reverse the order of characters in a given string. The steps are as follows

## Initialize Stack and Result String:
Create an empty stack to store characters.
Initialize an empty string to hold the reversed result.

## Push Characters onto the Stack:
Iterate through each character in the input string.
Push each character onto the stack.

## Get Stack Size:
Determine the size of the stack after pushing all characters.

## Pop Characters and Construct Reversed String:
Iterate through the stack.
Pop each character from the stack and concatenate it to the result string.

## Return Result:
The final result is the reversed string.
