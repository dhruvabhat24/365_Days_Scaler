# Explanation of Maximal Rectangle Algorithm

## Problem Overview
The given Java code is an implementation of an algorithm to find the area of the largest rectangle in a binary matrix. The input matrix `A` consists of 0s and 1s, where 1 represents a filled cell and 0 represents an empty cell. The goal is to find the maximum area rectangle that can be formed by considering consecutive filled cells in each row of the matrix.

## Main Function: `maximalRectangle`
1. **Base Case Check:**
   - The function begins by checking if the input matrix is null or empty. If so, it returns 0, indicating that there is no rectangle to consider.

2. **Matrix Dimensions:**
   - It then obtains the number of rows (`rows`) and columns (`cols`) in the matrix.

3. **Height Calculation:**
   - A new matrix `heights` is created, where each element represents the height of consecutive filled cells ending at that position in the original matrix.
   - The height is calculated based on the presence of a filled cell (1) in the corresponding position of the original matrix.

4. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram:**
   - For each row, it calculates the largest rectangle area by calling the `largestRectangleArea` function and updating the `maxArea` variable.

5. **Result:**
   - The maximum rectangle area across all rows is returned as the final result.

## Helper Function: `largestRectangleArea`
1. **Stack Initialization:**
   - The function initializes a stack to keep track of indices in the `heights` array.

2. **Loop through Heights:**
   - It iterates through each height in the `heights` array, adding an extra iteration for the case where `i` reaches the length of the `heights` array.

3. **Stack Operations:**
   - The stack is used to maintain a non-decreasing order of heights.
   - For each height, it compares with the height at the top of the stack.
   - If the current height is smaller, it pops elements from the stack and calculates the area of the rectangle formed by the popped height.
   - The width of the rectangle is determined by the difference between the current index `i` and the index at the top of the stack.
   - The maximum area is updated accordingly.

4. **Final Result:**
   - The function returns the maximum rectangle area.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the nested loops:
  - The first loop iterates through each cell of the input matrix, taking O(rows * cols) time.
  - The second loop in `largestRectangleArea` iterates through each element of the `heights` array, taking O(cols) time for each row.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(rows * cols).

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is determined by the additional matrix `heights` and the stack used in the `largestRectangleArea` function.
- The space complexity is O(rows * cols) for the `heights` matrix and O(cols) for the stack.

## Conclusion
- The algorithm efficiently solves the problem by calculating the heights of consecutive filled cells in each row and then finding the largest rectangle area using a stack-based approach.
