# Gas Station Tour - Circular Route Check

## Overview

This Java program addresses the "Gas Station Tour" problem, determining whether a vehicle can complete a circular route based on the available fuel at each gas station.

## Approach

### Initialization:

- Initialize three variables: `start`, `curr`, and `currg` to keep track of the current gas station, current index, and remaining gas, respectively.
- Obtain the lengths of the input arrays `A` and `B`, representing gas stations and fuel at each station.

### Invalid Input Handling:

- Check for potential invalid input scenarios:
  - If the lengths of arrays `A` and `B` are not equal.
  - If either array is empty.

### Single Station Edge Case:

- Check for the special case where there is only one gas station.
- Verify if it's possible to complete the circular route in this scenario.

### Circular Route Check:

- Utilize a while loop to iterate through each gas station as a potential starting point.
- Attempt to complete the circular route, adjusting the current gas and station index.
- If a circular route is successfully completed, return the starting index.

### No Circular Route:

- If no circular route is found after iterating through all gas stations, return -1.
